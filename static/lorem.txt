The Tapestry of Life

In the quiet dawn where shadows fade,
Life begins anew, in colors laid.
Threads of laughter, strands of tears,
Woven together through all our years.

Each moment a stitch, both bold and fine,
A tapestry rich, where stories entwine.
Joy dances lightly, sorrow may sigh,
Yet through every storm, we learn to fly.

Mountains and valleys, the paths we roam,
In the heart of the journey, we find our home.
With every heartbeat, a rhythm so true,
Life is a canvasâ€”painted by you.

Embrace the chaos, the calm, the strife,
For every twist brings the gift of life.
In the whispers of twilight, the bright morning light,
We find our purpose, our spirit takes flight.

I hope you enjoyed it!
